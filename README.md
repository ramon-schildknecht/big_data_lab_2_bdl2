# Big Data Lab 2
The overall goal was to  set up a Hadoop platform on Ubuntu, get a big data file, process it trough the data pipeline into Hadoop Distributed File System and answer defined questions with different technologies (pySpark, Spark SQL and more). 

One can get an idea from the file xy.

This repo stores the necessary documenting pictures for the project, too.
